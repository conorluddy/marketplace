```

```


## Plugins

| Plugin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **github-labels** | Structured GitHub issue labels — priority, clarity, risk, blast radius, size, parallelism, sequencing, and type |
| **swift-accessibility** | Audit, fix, and scaffold SwiftUI accessibility modifiers for VoiceOver and AI agents |
| **liquid-glass** | iOS 26 Liquid Glass effects in SwiftUI and UIKit — API reference, design rules, and patterns |
| **sonos-cli** | Control Sonos speakers — playback, volume, grouping, queue management, and music search |
| **openhue** | Control Philips Hue lights — brightness, color, scenes, and automation |
| **team-work** | Decompose a session's JTBD into a parallelizable agent-team plan — tiered models (haiku/sonnet/opus), specialist subagents, dependency waves |
| **and-then** | Ambiguity-first planning — resolve unknowns before committing to implementation  |
| **code-review** | Review code against a style guide focused on progressive disclosure, explicit contracts, agentic patterns, and token economics — severity-grouped findings with file:line refs and concrete fixes |
| **ios-aso** | Generate paste-ready English (U.S.) App Store Optimization metadata (ASO.md) for an iOS app by scanning its Swift/SwiftUI codebase — App Name, Subtitle, Keywords, category, screenshot captions, and research notes |
| **[spec-speak](plugins/spec-speak-plugin/README.md)** | Convert rough notes into rigorous, testable specs — EARS requirement templates, RFC 2119 keywords, INCOSE/ISO 29148 rules, Gherkin acceptance criteria, and interactive prompts for undecided product questions |

## Adding a plugin

Each plugin follows this structure:

```
plugins/<name>-plugin/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json       # name, description, version
└── skills/
    └── <skill-name>/
        └── SKILL.md      # Skill definition (frontmatter + instructions)
```

After creating the plugin directory, add an entry to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.
